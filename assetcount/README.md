# Asset count GO Language program

This is meant to be simply a technology preview of using GO with the Qualys API.  The Go language lends itself to Qualys API use
cases very well, as the langauge supports http, XML parsing, and concurrency (multi threading) with its standard libraries.  

This was my first GO program I used to figure out the aforementioned HTTP calling, XML parsing and the like.  
I will extend this, and plan to add an example to the host detection directpory as well using channels
